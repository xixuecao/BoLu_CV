## **Projects (2018-2021)**

* **Process Integration**
<br>1. Develop, design and check the inline (Fabcell) and end of line (ePCM/oPCM) monitor structures of silicon photonics devices by python script.
in full process. 
<br>2. Maintain and update design pdk and rules as COT member, help product tape out.
<br>3. Run lots of products at the back end of line (BEOL).
<br>4. Transfer mask design of full device from manual to script.
<br>5. Automatically capture Mask data to standardize it, then build a standard format library with FAB.
* **Design of 32 × 32 GaN Mini-LED Display System**
<br>The driving circuit (PCB) and display circuit (FPC) designed by Altium Designer were combined with custom made FPGA to demonstrate a Blue Mini-LED display system. Flip-chip technology was used to fabricate 1024 LED chips by transfer bonding each pixel on solder paste precisely.
* **Studies of Thermal Stability of Flexible Transparent Mini-LED Array**
<br>The studies of the color change and thermal distribution of a flexible and transparent 32×32 mini-LED array on PET substrate up to a brightness rating of 5000 nits at room temperature was presented. The calculated color differences from the EL spectra at three different brightness are far less than the color discrimination threshold of the human eye corresponding to 0.005 at all testing brightness and meet the display industry requirement for color difference.
* **Fabrication of GaN/InGaN Micro-LED**
<br>The InGaN/GaN epitaxy wafer was covered by photoresist and SiO2 partially, and ICP system was used to etch mesa for n-contact. After removing the SiO2, the Ni/Au was used to spread the current. After the current spread layer, electrodes were made for current injection.
